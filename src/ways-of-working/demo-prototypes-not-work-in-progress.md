# Demo prototypes, not work in progress

## Problem
During the team demo, feedback from the audience triggers major rework.  
Team gets frustrated and the delivery roadmap needs adjustment.

## Context
- The demo is a recurring meeting (weekly/bi-weekly), whose goal is to collect feedback for in progress initiatives
- The audience is individuals outside the team who are interested in the initiative

## Solution
Demo prototypes to collect feedback.  
Make it easy for anybody to check work in progress autonomously.

### Shorten the feedback loop
Feedback should be collected as soon as the definition of done has been agreed upon.  
This information is already available with prototypes, no need to wait for coding to start.  

Prototypes can be for instance Figma files or code built with LLM and made available on a preview deployment. 

### Everybody tests in prod
Work in progress should be easily accessible by anyone in the company.  
For instance, by setting feature toggles state on demand via a browser extension.
