# Ways of working

## Ways of working drive success
Objectives matter, but they’re not enough.
Every company sets quarterly goals, yet only a few succeed.  
What sets them apart? Effective ways of working.

Objectives are the steering wheel, but ways of working are the engine.

## The three principles of ways of working
- Focused work – Minimize distractions to get meaningful work done
- Definition of done – Clearly define when something is truly complete
- Short feedback loops – Get frequent feedback to improve quickly

These principles apply at every level, from company strategy to daily tasks.
