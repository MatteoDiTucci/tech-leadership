# Introduction

### What is this book about
This book is a brain dump of tech leadership problems and my proposed solutions.  
It has no pretension to be complete or perfect.
On the contrary, following the [Cunninghams's law](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Cunningham%27s_Law), I expect it to be challenged so that the best solution can be actually found.

### Who I am
My name is Matteo Di Tucci, I am software engineer and tech lead at air up.

### Teach me back
I really appreciate any feedback about the book and my current understanding of tech leadership.
