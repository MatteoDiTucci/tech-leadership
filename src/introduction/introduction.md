# Introduction

### Current status
In progress: publishing a new chapter roughly every week.

### What is this book about
This book is a brain dump of tech leadership problems and my proposed solutions.  
It has no pretension to be complete or perfect.
On the contrary, following the [Cunninghams's law](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Cunningham%27s_Law), I expect it to be challenged so that the best solution can be found.

### Who I am
My name is Matteo Di Tucci, I am software engineer and tech lead at air up.

### Teach me back
I really appreciate any feedback about the book and my current understanding of tech leadership.
You can share any feedback by opening a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/MatteoDiTucci/tech-leadership/issues) or a [pull request](https://github.com/MatteoDiTucci/tech-leadership/pulls)


### Tech leadership
As taught me in Thoughtworks, the *what* of tech leadership is:
- People cultivation
- Predictable delivery
- Stakeholders management
- Tech vision
  - Cross-functional requirements
  - Target architecture
  - Tech principles
  - Tech radar

The *how* is:
- [Ways of working](../ways-of-working/introduction.md)
- [Tech expertise](../tech-expertise/introduction.md)
